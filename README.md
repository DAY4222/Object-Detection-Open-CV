# Object-Detection-Open-CV
 Open CV Object Detection for video, image and webcam. Open ipynb file to view.

In this script, one can process any image, video or use their webcam, leverage mobilenet_v3 a object detection model, to identify objects seen in the files. The 80 objects it can detect are found within the file named "labels". 

This program was done as the skeleton of a bigger project. I want to double check all NASA Persevere photos for humans. Then have it keep updating every month on a website with the website having a huge indicator saying "No humans found on MARS" and one day " Human found on MARS".

MobileNetV3 is a convolutional neural network that is designed for mobile phone CPUs, meaing its light weight and can be used for embded systems aswell. This model was selected as I could run this script on a little rover with webcam for eyes as a future project. The model's footprint is very appealing compared to other models.
